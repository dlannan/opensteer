# opensteer
Javascript port of Opensteer

http://opensteer.sourceforge.net/

Currently a close port of the original opensteer. There are other ports but they do not contain many of the 'nice' features of the original, like the location database, and some of the steer library features. 

I have implemented only the pedestrian demo. I'll add more of the demos at a later date (for testing). Feel free to download and use this library as you want, and thankyou to Craig Reynolds and Sony for the original library.
